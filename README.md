# Umělecké citace

## Background

Umělecké citace (Artistic citations) is a minimalistic Next.js-based web application intended for students of art history in the Czech Republic. Unlike most fields, the art history citation standard does not conform to the widely used ČSN ISO 690 standard for citations, but is instead based on a field-specific citation style mandated by the Umění (Art) journal published by the Czech Academy of Sciences. 

Umění's citation style differs from the ČSN ISO 690 standard in a plethora of areas, ensuring ample confusion for outsiders to the field who are already familiar with the ISO norm from other fields or previous studies. It also means that tools widely used in Czech academia for citation handling, such as citace.com, cannot be used to manage citations in art history papers. 

The aim of Umělecké citace is to provide students of art history a replacement for citace.com, which does not cater to the niche standard mandated by their field. 

## Features

In the application, users can generate citations for several publication types, including journal articles, exhibition catalogues, and academic theses. Support for additional publication types is currently being worked on.

## Availability

The application can be accessed on a temporary domain, citace-umeni.azurewebsites.net.
